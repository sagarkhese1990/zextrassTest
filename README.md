# WELCOME!
This is a starter app based on Angular 14 and Boostrap 5, useful for the UI dev role application, run it using:

```npm i && ng serve```

We're asking you to create the home page of a brand new Music App in which the user can list his favourite albums and artists in a smart listener and a recently played section.

You can find a first mockup of the final application here screenshots/application.png and a mockup of the only section we are asking you to build (the home) here screenshots/home.png.

To simulate a backend endpoint response you can use the included smart.json and recent.json files in which you can find usable data to fill both lists.

## What we are asking
We'd like to build an application that could be maintainable and easy to extend with new functionalities. 

Focus on the home section only, starting from the "home.module" and develop the two sections:
1. Smart listener
2. List of recently played

Note

The music player in the smart listener section, is only a representation; you can create a simple button that 
switches between play and pause icons.

## What we are expecting

### Standard
1. Reusable components
2. Ability to reproduce the mockup layout
3. Use of clean code principles and separation of concerns

### Nice to have
1. Well tested code

## How to give back
Email us a link to a repo, or a compressed archive containing the modified app without node_modules and other not 
code related folders (like ide, .angular..) to our hr specialist.

That's it, have a nice coding session :-)

# AngularBase

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
